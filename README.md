# Volume Knob for Android
This is a simple design for a Volume controller for any Android Head unit with a USB port. Using the touch buttons is infuriating and quite dangerous, so I decided to create my own volume knob.

## Requirements
An Arduino Leonardo is required, but any Arduino that has HID capability works.
A 3D printer.
Standard rotary encoder.

## Wiring Layout

## 3D printing the enclosure
It is best to use PLA to print the housing and knob at 0.3mm layer height. I have included the Fusion360 files I used if the sizing of your rotary encoder is different.
